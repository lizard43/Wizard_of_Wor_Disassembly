# Wizard of Wor — Z80 Source Reconstruction

This repository contains the disassembly, source code reconstruction, and technical documentation for the classic arcade game **Wizard of Wor** (Midway, 1980).

## 🛠️ Build & Tools

* **Assembler:** zmac v1.3 (Z80 Macro Cross Assembler)
  * [Windows Binary (`zmac.exe`)](https://ballyalley.com/ml/ml_tools/Zmac13_win32.zip)
  * [Linux Source and Binary (`zmac`)](https://ballyalley.com/ml/ml_tools/zmac-linux.zip)
* **Primary Source:** `src/wow_disassembly.asm`

### Building the ROMs ---> Windows 10 / 11

The Windows build script searches for `zmac` in the following order:

1. The executable named by the `ZMAC` environment variable.
2. `tools\zmac.exe` in the repository.
3. `zmac.exe` in `PATH`.

To assemble the source code into MAME-ready ROMs, run the build script from the root directory:

```cmd
build.bat
```

The script will automatically compile the assembly and deposit the final, ready-to-play binaries (`wow.x1` through `wow.x8`) along with the packaged `wow.zip` into a new `roms/` folder in your project root.

To select a specific assembler executable outside the default search locations:

```cmd
set ZMAC=C:\path\to\zmac.exe
build.bat
```

### Building the ROMs ---> Linux

The Linux build requires Bash, `zip`, and a Linux build of `zmac`. The build script searches for `zmac` in the following order:

1. The executable named by the `ZMAC` environment variable.
2. `tools/zmac` in the repository.
3. `zmac` in `PATH`.

From the repository root, make the script executable once and run it:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

To select a specific assembler executable:

```bash
ZMAC=/path/to/zmac ./build.sh
```

The script will automatically compile the assembly and deposit the final, ready-to-play binaries (`wow.x1` through `wow.x7`) and the packaged wow.zip into the `roms/` folder in your project root.

### Optional SC-01 speech ROM
The SC-01 speech ROM is not part of the reconstructed program source. If a file named `sc01.bin` exists in `roms/`, the build script automatically includes it in `roms/gorf.zip`. If the file is absent, the build continues and packages only the eight Gorf program ROMs.

## Coding Standards & Guidelines

To maintain visual and structural consistency across all arcade disassembly repositories, source code edits should follow our shared project standards.

| A Note on Flexibility |
| :--- |
| **These formatting standards are meant for guidance, not to force you into a coding straitjacket.** While a consistent layout is highly encouraged as a best practice, you are free to make exceptions without consequence. If adhering to these specific columns compromises the readability of a complex routine or data block, or you just don't like the look of the code,  take the liberty to break the rule. **Readability and accuracy always come first.** |

* **Z80 Coding Style & Layout** - Column alignments, spacing, and comment conventions.
* **TERSE Naming Rules**        - Capitalization, label length, and internal jump conventions.
